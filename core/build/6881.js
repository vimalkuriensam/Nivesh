But, in the pandemic years, the cause of inflation can be complicated due to the response from the government. However, we have listed the most common causes of inflation.\n\n          Demand-pull inflation: While the aggregate demand for some services and products is higher than the aggregate supply in the economy, it results in demand-pull inflation. Demand can be higher than supply, and it causes the price to move upward.\n          Cost-push inflation: While the cost of materials and wages is on the rise, we call it cost-push inflation. An organization having the capabilities of creating a monopoly will be one of the contributors to cost-push inflation.\n          Higher money supply: The total monetary amount in circulation is related to the increased money supply. It includes coins, cash, bank accounts, and balances. While there is a faster increase in the money supply, it can cause inflation. A high amount of products can chase too few products.\n          Devaluation: It refers to the downward adjustment in the exchange rate of the country. It will reduce the values of the currency. The currency's devaluation will make exports less expensive. It will encourage foreign countries to purchase devalued products. Devaluation will make these foreign goods costlier. Consumers of the devaluing nation will purchase domestic goods and not the imported ones.\n          The rise in salary: Wages are included in the production costs. When there is a rise in wages, businesses will have lower margins. They will balance the higher productivity and wage growth. Due to the increasing wages, consumers will be able to pay a higher amount without affecting their purchasing potentials.\n          Regulations and policies: Some policies are responsible for demand-pull and cost-push inflation. While there are tax subsidies for some goods, there will be a rise in demand. There will be a rise in cost when there is a higher demand. Moreover, stringent regulations and rent stabilization rules will cause a rise in costs. The overall economic environment will be inflationary.\n          Several other factors can be the cause of inflation:\n          Technology\n          Velocity of money\n          Demographic trends\n          Unemployment rate\n          Savings rate\n          Debt to income ratios\n          The level of impact of these factors can be different. Inflation is one of the parts of any economy. When everything is normal, it indicates less value of the money each year. Make sure that you are adjusting your living standards to inflation."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"What are the Ways of Preventing Inflation?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"The major strategy to avoid inflation is to amend the monetary policy and adjust the interest rate. You can find a lower demand and higher interest rate. Simultaneously, a lower interest rate will result in higher demand. There are some other ways of preventing the inflation rate.\n          Control the money supply and prevent inflation. The rate of money supply indicates how much money is circulated throughout the country. The RBI is responsible for controlling the money supply.\n          A higher rate of income tax will lower the expenditure, and it will avoid inflationary pressures.\n          It is important to introduce policies to make the economy more efficient and reduce long-term costs."}}]}],retirementCorpus:[{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"BreadcrumbList",itemListElement:[{"@type":"ListItem",position:1,name:"Home",item:"https://nivesh.com/en/"},{"@type":"ListItem",position:2,name:"Retirement Planning",item:"https://nivesh.com/en/calculators/retirement-planning"}]},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage",mainEntity:[{"@type":"Question",name:"How to Calculate the Retirement Corpus?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"Investing in a good retirement scheme is a good decision.

You can use a Time Value of Money calculator online.\n          While looking at the components it may look like a complicated equation, the TVM calculator can help.\n\n          There are two ways to look at this:\n          For calculating future value of money:\n          FV = PV x [ 1 + (i / n) ] (n x t)\n          If you add variables to the above formula, you will get the future value of money. Let’s say you have INR 10,000 invested in a mutual fund that gives you 10% compounded interest for one year. Your future value of money will be:\n\n          FV = 10,000x [ 1 + (10% / 1) ] (1 x 1)\n          FV= INR 11,000.\n          Looking at the above, you will need to have the current compounding interest rate as well as the tenure of the investment.\n          You can also calculate your present value of money by slightly changing the above equation:\n\n          PV= FV / [ 1 + (i / n) ] (n x t)\n          Using the same values from above:\n          PV: 11,000/ {1+ (10% / 1) } (1 x 1)\n          PV= INR 10,000\n          When you look at the components that are involved in the time value of a money calculator, you have to consider that the effect of the compounding period has on the calculations. Compounding periods can be daily, monthly, or quarterly depending on the type of investment.\n          When the compounding period changes, the future value of money will also change.\n          Daily Compounding: FV = INR 10,000 x [1 + (10% / 365)] ^ (365 x 1) = INR 11,052\n          Monthly Compounding: FV = INR10,000 x [1 + (10% / 12)] ^ (12 x 1) = INR 11,047\n          Quarterly Compounding: FV = INR 10,000 x [1 + (10% / 4)] ^ (4 x 1) = INR 11,038\n          The above example shows that the time value of money not only depends on the interest and the tenure but also the number of times the compounding calculations are done."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"What can the TVM formula calculator solve?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"Using a TVM solver calculator can assist in making better investment decisions. While the formula informs the present and future value of money, this TVM online calculator can be used to understand the other variable factors as well.\n          The TVM calculator can also solve the value of each payment in a compounding period, the number of periods as well as the rate of interest.\n          Apart from the above, you can also use the TVM calculator for understanding the below:\n          Future value of an annuity: Annuity is the constant cash flow on an investment. One example of annuity is the premium payments on life insurance policy. This annuity is received at the end of each period, it’s called a deferred annuity. If you want to calculate the future value of your annuity, your above TVM formula changes to accommodate the years of investment. If you invest INR 1000 for 5 years with a 10% ROI, your future value of the annuity will be INR 6105\n          Present Value of Annuity: This concept is the reversal of the future value of the annuity. Since the focus is on present value, you will factor the future value of money along with the tenure and rate of interest. If you are expecting to receive INR 100 for 3 years while your ROI is at 10%, your present value will be calculated at INR 248.69.\n          Growing perpetuity: The time value of money calculator can also calculate the growing perpetuity of an investment. Perpetuity is the annuity that you would receive for an indefinite period of time. Based on the ROI per year and the start year of the investment, you can use the TVM calculator to calculate the growing perpetuity as well."}}]}],becomeACorepati:[{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"BreadcrumbList",itemListElement:[{"@type":"ListItem",position:1,name:"Home",item:"https://nivesh.com/en/"},{"@type":"ListItem",position:2,name:"Become a Crorepati",item:"https://nivesh.com/en/calculators/become-a-crorepati"}]},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage",mainEntity:[{"@type":"Question",name:"How to Become A Crorepati?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"You may find multiple approaches to become a crorepati.

",Description:"The major concept is to save some money every month and use the total amount for future education. However, you have to save it based on your child’s educational goals and lifestyle.<br/>\n                    A child education plan refers to a type of insurance policy to protect some money for further studies. The money will secure your child's future. At the end of maturity, your child will receive the lump-sum payout from pursuing education.<br/>\n                    The academic institutes in India and foreign countries charge a high amount for different courses. Moreover, the cost of these courses will be higher after a few years due to inflation. Although you have good earnings today, you cannot secure your kids' future without investments and savings. With child education planning, you can ensure sufficient financial corpus for educational needs.<br/>\n                    Investment is the best strategy to make your child's education planning successful. The age of your children may be 3 to 5 years. There are different financial instruments available to you. The most common ones are Mutual Funds, NSC accounts, PPF accounts, Equity Investments, and Fixed Deposits. Learn your risk appetite and apply your knowledge to choose from any of these options. <br/>\n                    The safest ones are FDs and bank PPFs. But they will give you lower returns. That is why you can look for some other alternatives. Investors with low-risk endurance can choose equity.\n                    "},{Heading:"Which plan is best for child education?",Description:"You can find Child education plans of different types- the traditional endowment plans and market-linked ULIP plans. Parents have to decide on the most right plans after assessing the risk factors and the desired financial corpus for their kids’ future education. <br/>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li><b>Unit Linked Insurance Plans</b></li>: Based on the current market conditions, they offer returns. These plans focus more on the equity market. As a parent, you have to find out the amount you would like to allocate for every component related to ULIP. Equity markets offer higher risk, although rewards are higher. The proper management of ULIP plans will enable you to get attractive returns.\n                        <li><b>Endowment-based plans for child education</b></li>: They are conventional options and provide a fixed payout after the chosen period and on maturity. They are money-back plans. Thus, you may also prefer them for other financial solutions for your children. You have to know the amount you will receive at maturity. <br/>\n                        Some parents are still confused and cannot decide on the best child education plans for their kids. Both types are beneficial to them. You have to select the plans based on your risk profile. For instance, in the case of a low-risk profile, you can prefer traditional endowment plans. They offer more secured returns than ULIPs.<br/>\n                        In most cases, child insurance plans give you 4% to 8% returns. But, the earlier investment will enable you to manage your kids’ education needs easily.<br/>\n                        Children below 18 years can invest money in MF with the guidance of their guardians.

It is best for long-term investment and saves the investor from the effect of market volatility.<br/>\n\n                        Child mutual fund schemes help in the allocation of funds for particular goals. Therefore, there will be clear segments of your investment portfolio based on your purposes. You can check the performance of every segment. The mutual funds will be useful for different needs like child’s healthcare, home purchase, child’s schooling, and higher education.\n                    </ul>\n                    "},{Heading:"How Does Child Education Planning Calculator Work?",Description:"The best child education plan calculator works innovatively by identifying the future value and calculating the corpus within a stated number of years.
