The price rates of services and goods are never stable in an economy, and it is known as inflation. Due to price inflation, products in the market become costlier. But, when the opposite things happen, we call it deflation. Deflation causes the reduction of services and products. Before creating your investment portfolio, you must learn about inflation. Inflation can affect your returns on investment. A free online inflation calculator can help you to learn about future inflation.<br/> Inflation refers to the continuous rise in the prices of services and goods. It measures the rate of increase in the current rates of some products and services. The purchasing power of a currency starts declining due to inflation. Thus, inflation results in the reduction of the value of your money. Policymakers try to make the prices stable and keep inflation low.\r\n                    Inflation is defined as a percentage. Wholesale Price Index and Consumer Price Index are two concepts relevant to inflation. WPI indicates the variations to the wholesale level price level, whereas CPI is about the effect on the retail level price level. CPI is a highly popular indicator to identify deflation and inflation in the economy. In 2013, CPI replaced WPI in the Indian economy. The difference in the percentage in CPI throughout a period refers to inflation for consumer goods. However, it reveals retail inflation only.

In due course, it will decrease the value of your financial savings. The reason behind it is the increase in price.\r\n\r\n                    For instance, you may have saved Rs. 5,000 today, and the worth of this amount was higher a few years ago. It never denotes the loss of money. But, the purchasing potential of Rs 5,000 after 10 years will be less.\r\n                    The best alternative is to keep money in a financial instrument. The interest will balance out inflammatory effects. But, it will be effective in balancing the loss of inflation.\r\n\r\n                    Based on the type of investment, you need to find the effect of inflation. Bonds and other similar investments give a fixed annual return. You will get a good return for purchasing commodities. However, the value of this return will be low after 4 years.\r\n\r\n                    The effect of inflation in the case of equity investments is miscellaneous. While the inflation rate is high, it indicates a strong economy. Several companies will have good business, and they will pay higher wages. But, they need a higher investment to buy raw materials. It will affect the company’s profit margin.

But, in the pandemic years, the cause of inflation can be complicated due to the response from the government. However, we have listed the most common causes of inflation.<br/>\r\n\r\n                    <b>Demand-pull inflation:</B>\r\n                    While the aggregate demand for some services and products is higher than the aggregate supply in the economy, it results in demand-pull inflation.\r\n                    Demand can be higher than supply, and it causes the price to move upward.<br/>\r\n\r\n                    <b>Cost-push inflation:</b>\r\n                    While the cost of materials and wages is on the rise, we call it cost-push inflation. An organization having the capabilities of creating a monopoly will be one of the contributors to cost-push inflation.<br/>\r\n\r\n                    <b>Higher money supply:</b>\r\n\r\n                    The total monetary amount in circulation is related to the increased money supply. It includes coins, cash, bank accounts, and balances. While there is a faster increase in the money supply, it can cause inflation.  A high amount of products can chase too few products. <br/>\r\n\r\n                    <b>Devaluation:</b>\r\n                    It refers to the downward adjustment in the exchange rate of the country. It will reduce the values of the currency. The currency's devaluation will make exports less expensive. It will encourage foreign countries to purchase devalued products. Devaluation will make these foreign goods costlier. Consumers of the devaluing nation will purchase domestic goods and not the imported ones.<br/>\r\n\r\n                   <b>The rise in salary:</b>\r\n                    Wages are included in the production costs. When there is a rise in wages, businesses will have lower margins.  They will balance the higher productivity and wage growth.\r\n                    Due to the increasing wages, consumers will be able to pay a higher amount without affecting their purchasing potentials.<br/>\r\n\r\n                    <b>Regulations and policies:</b>\r\n\r\n                    Some policies are responsible for demand-pull and cost-push inflation. While there are tax subsidies for some goods, there will be a rise in demand. There will be a rise in cost when there is a higher demand. Moreover, stringent regulations and rent stabilization rules will cause a rise in costs. The overall economic environment will be inflationary.<br/>\r\n\r\n                    Several other factors can be the cause of inflation-\r\n\r\n                    <li>Technology,</li>\r\n                    <li>Velocity of money</li>\r\n                    <li>Demographic trends</li>\r\n                    <li>Unemployment rate,</li>\r\n                    <li>Savings rate</li>\r\n                    <li>Debt to income ratios,</li>\r\n                    The level of impact of these factors can be different.\r\n                    Inflation is one of the parts of any economy.

A time value of money calculator can help you find the future value of the money you currently hold or current value of the money that you will get in future.<br/>\r\n                    A TVM calculator will help in understanding what will be the value of money you hold today, tomorrow.

This is because today's money can earn interest between now and then or what you can buy today with the same amount of money may be more expensive in future.<br/>\r\n                    It is important to know how this concept works for managing your personal finances.<br/>\r\n                    Let’s say you have INR 1,000 with you. Instead of keeping that money in hand, you decide to deposit that amount in your savings account. Over time, interest adds to this principal amount. As more time passes, both the principal amount and the interest received earn additional interest. This is called compounding interest. In finance terms, this is called the power of compounding.<br/>\r\n                    If you had kept the money aside instead of depositing it, you would have lost out on the additional income that is earned. Not just that, the buying power of that money would have also been reduced because of changing market factors including inflation. Inflation makes everything expensive in the future. So unless your savings grow in value, you will lose on the real value of the money.<br/><br/>\r\n                    Consider this:<br/>\r\n                    If you had a chance to take INR 1,00,000 today instead of taking it next year, which would you choose?<br/>\r\n                    You would choose to take it today as this money would have more power today as compared to the next year. There are two reasons for this:<br/>\r\n\r\n                    1. High purchasing power: Over time as inflation increases, it is safe to consider that INR 1,00,000 will get you more goods and services today as compared to the future.<br/>\r\n\r\n                    2. Risks involved: There are always risks involved when it comes to making money in the future. One of the biggest risks is that there is no guarantee that the money that was promised to you would still be available. So wouldn’t it make more sense to have the money in hand today, as compared to the future?<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n                    Both the above examples show the time value of money. And the time value of the money calculator can show you the future value of the money that you have invested today. <br/>\r\n                    There are a few key components when it comes to the TVM solver calculator: <br/>\r\n                    1. Present value (PV): This is the amount of money we have after applying any discounting rate on the future value<br/>\r\n                    2. Future Value (FV): This is the amount of money we have after applying a compounding rate on the present t value <br/>\r\n                    3. Interest/Discounts (i): This is the rate of discount or compounding applied to the money to calculate the present or future value of money<br/>\r\n                    4. Tenure(t): This is the tenure we want to calculate the present or future value of money. It can be weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, and annually. <br/>\r\n                    5. Compounding year (n): This refers to the number of compounding periods per year.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n                    <b>Build Your Desired Corpus Accurately by using Nivesh’s TVM Calculator.</b>\r\n                    `\r\n                }\r\n\r\n            ],\r\n            \"Thirdbanners\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"Heading\": \"How to use the TVM calculator\",\r\n                    \"Description\": `If you need to know the time value of money, a TVM solver calculator is a good tool to use.
