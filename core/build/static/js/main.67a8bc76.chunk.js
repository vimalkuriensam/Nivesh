Here the issuer may by anyone like Government, State governments, Trusts, companies, Municipality etc","BondHowWorks":"How it works","BondHowWorksDesc":"There are two methods of buying a bond.<ul><li>Primary (Directly from Issuer)</li><li>Secondary (From the secondary market on Exchange)</li></ul>Buyers need to be aware of two primary aspects, market price and yield. Market price is what is quoted on an exchange for buying or selling, and the yield shows what you earn every year by holding the bond. The latter is calculated by dividing the annual coupon or interest rate by the market price. Stocks are bought with the expectation that price rise will lead to profits. In bonds, however, the buy price is not always lower than the face value of the bond that you get back at maturity. What really matters is the yield.<br /><br />Bond prices rise when yields fall, and vice versa. For example, a bond issued at Rs100 with a 10% coupon and maturity of 2 years is sold at the end of year 1 at Rs101. This is a yield of 9.9% and makes for 11% return (Rs1 on the price + Rs10 coupon). At the end of the next year, the buyer gets back Rs100 principal and Rs10 as coupon, but that is not a return of 10%, rather it is 9.9%, because you paid Rs101 to acquire the bond. If you had bought when the yield was low, chances are you won\u2019t be able to profit much as a rising yield means lower prices. If the trend is for yields to move lower, then the opposite is likely to occur.","BondBestBuy":"Best Bonds to Buy in India","BondBestBuyDesc":"Investors can buy bonds in India, various types of bonds exist. For example: Tax Free Bonds - where the interest earned is tax free in the hands of investors, Capital Gain Bonds or 54EC bonds which are the fixed income instruments that provide capital gains tax exemption under section 54EC to the investors, Corporate Bonds, GOI Bonds, etc. Also NCDs are of two types -Secured NCDs that are backed by the issuer company\u2019s assets and Unsecured NCDs which are issued based on the creditworthiness of the issuer (not backed by the asset).","FAQ":"Frequently Asked Questions","FAQ1":"1.

These are extremely safe and risk-free investments, which focus on stable returns with capital preservation.","HMF66":"Equity Savings Fund \u2013 These are taxed as equity funds as they invest a minimum of 65% of the capital in equity assets while diversifying a minimum of 10% of the capital in debt securities to target both capital appreciation as well as revenue generation. The exposure from the equity segment is hedged with debt instruments to cushion the risk.","HMF67":"Dynamic Asset Allocation Fund \u2013 These are also known as Balanced Advantage Funds, as the fund managers change the asset allocation as per the market conditions to reap the most advantage. The investors choosing this fund should have a moderately high-risk appetite and the investment horizon should also be up to 5 years. Say for example equity prices are low, then the fund manager will invest more in equities aiming at capital appreciation while buying the stocks at low valuations, and the opposite if the equity prices are too high. These are usually taxed as equity funds, but the investors should always check the scheme information document (SID) thoroughly before investing.","HMF68":"Multi-Asset Fund \u2013 The basic philosophy behind these funds is to replicate a fully diversified portfolio of investments through one product, by investing in multiple assets across the class with a minimum of 3 asset classes. Investors who do not want to manage their portfolios themselves and maintain a diversified risk profile should opt for such funds.","HMF69":"Aggressive Hybrid fund \u2013 These are also known as hybrid equity mutual funds owing to the high asset allocation to equity or equity-related instruments to the tune of up to 80%, the minimum requirement being 65%. The remaining is invested in debt instruments. Given the high portion of investment in equities, these are also taxed as equity funds and often lead to capital appreciation if held for the medium term.","HMF70":"5. How Long should I Stay Invested in Hybrid Funds?","HMF71":"Hybrid Mutual Funds act as a gateway for investors who want to venture into the market. There are many different types of Hybrid Mutual Funds which are composed to match the investment goals of the investors and their varying risk profiles, trading strategies or preferences.

Can I apply for a joint loan with my friend?","IHL74":"No. A lender would only allow you to apply for a joint home loan if the application is co-signed by one or more members of your immediate family. Thus, your friend does not qualify.","IHL75":"Q7. Who can be joint borrowers in case of a home loan?","IHL76":"Immediate family members such as your parents, spouse and children are allowed to be joint borrowers in case of a home loan.","IHL77":"Q8. What is the maximum number of joint borrowers for a home loan?","IHL78":"The maximum number of joint borrowers in case of a home loan is fixed at 6. However, only family members such as parents, siblings and spouse can be co-borrowers for a home loan in India. Additionally, having a co-borrower who has a robust credit history and good credit score is preferable as compared to one with a low credit score.","IHL79":"Q9. What is a floating rate home loan?","IHL80":"If the interest rate on the loan varies periodically over the loan tenure, then it is called a floating rate home loan. Lenders have their own base rate which determines the rate of interest charged on a home loan. The base rates of banks are revised from time to time based on RBI directives as well as other factors, which leads to an increase or decrease in the EMI amount payable.","IHL81":"Q10. What is a fixed rate home loan?","IHL82":"Fixed rate home loans are offered at a predetermined interest rate during the loan period and these remain unchanged during the loan period irrespective of market conditions. This can be a huge benefit when market volatility starts affecting interest rates. For instance, if the RBI increases interest rates on loans, then people with fixed rate home loan will not be affected by any increase or decrease in the market interest rates and the EMI amount will remain unchanged. This type of home loan is less popular these days.","IHL83":"Q11. How is the RLLR method going to affect my current home loan?","IHL84":"As per recently updated RBI rules, banks are required to use the RLLR (Repo linked lending rate) method to determine the interest rate on home loans. In case of a floating rate home loan, the banks are now required to change the interest rate either yearly or every six months. In case you have a fixed rate home loan, you can get in touch with your bank to get information regarding the conversion of your fixed rate home loan to the new RRLR-based floating interest rate. At present, the introduction of the new RRLR regime has led to a reduction in applicable home loan interest rates.","IHL85":"Q12. Can I switch from a floating rate home loan to a fixed rate?","IHL86":"Yes. A few lenders do offer you the option of switching from a floating rate to a fixed rate home loan and the other way around. However, this is not applicable to all home loans and there are a few charges involved in implementing this conversion. Get in touch with your lender to get details regarding the procedure and requirements.","IHL87":"Q13. How do I repay my home loan?","IHL88":"There are different ways to pay off your loan such as issuing post-dated cheques for the tenure of the home loan, getting the amount deducted automatically from your salary or by issuing standard instructions to the lender for ECS (Electronic Clearing System) wherein the EMI is automatically deducted from your bank every month.","IHL89":"Q14. Should I apply for a home loan with a public or private bank?","IHL90":"Before zeroing in on a home loan, it is best to compare the various interest rates that would be applicable to you. When you apply for a home loan through Nivesh, you get the opportunity to apply for a home loan through both private and public-sector banks. Also, take into account, the fact that banks charge various processing and other related fees when you apply for a home loan and you should also consider these when applying for a home loan.","IHL91":"Q15. Is prepayment of home loan allowed?","IHL92":"Yes, one can repay the loan amount before completion of the scheduled loan tenure by making a lump sum payment towards paying off the loan. In such cases, the bank may decide to apply some penalties in the range of 2-3% of the principal amount outstanding. Some banks and NBFC (non-banking financial companies) do not charge any penalty on prepayment of a home loan.","IHL93":"Q16. What are the key charges associated with a home loan process?","IHL94":"Processing Fee- When applying for a loan, a fee is paid to the lender known as processing fee. The amount paid could be either a percentage of the loan amount or a fixed amount that is paid in lieu of carrying out the loan sanction formalities.","IHL95":"Commitment Fee- It is essential to avail the loan within a stipulated time period after it is processed and sanctioned otherwise some financial institutions levy a commitment fee. By paying the commitment fee, you are assured that you can access the loan at the interest rate and for the tenure that was initially agreed on. Most banks no longer charge this fee.","IHL96":"Pre-payment Charges- Banks/ financial institutions might charge a penalty if the entire loan amount is paid off before completion of the loan tenure. The penalty amount also known as foreclosure/pre-payment charges could be a maximum of 5% of the loan amount that is paid off before the completion of loan tenure.","IHL97":"Miscellaneous charges- Documentation, stamp duty, credit bureau report issuance charges and consultant charges are generally considered as miscellaneous charges by few lenders.","IHL98":"Q17. What documents do I need to submit with my home loan application?","IHL99":"The documents that need to be submitted may vary from one lender to the other. Some of the necessary documents to be submitted include the following-","IHL100":"Completed loan application form","IHL101":"Passport size photographs","IHL102":"Identity proof \u2013 PAN card/Passport/ DL/ Voters ID","IHL103":"Residence proof- telephone or electricity bill/ passport/ voter ID / property tax receipt","IHL104":"Bank statement for at least past 6 months and salary certificates/ latest acknowledged ITR","IHL105":"Copy of plan approved for the proposed construction/extension","IHL106":"Cost estimation/ valuation report from Bank\u2019s (or finance company) authorised surveyor/evaluator.","IHL107":"Allotment letter of housing board/ NOC of the society/Builder etc. as well as any other land use certificate/other","IHL108":"Q18. Is there any tax benefit available on home loans?","IHL109":"The tax benefit on home loan is divided into two sections-","IHL110":"Tax exemption on repayment of the home loan principal: This is the deduction allowed under Tax Section 80C with a maximum annual tax deduction of Rs, 150,000 under the section.","IHL111":"Tax benefit on the interest rate for a home loan: Under Section 24 of the Income Tax Act, you can avail the tax benefit on the amount of interest paid on a home loan to the maximum limit of Rs. 2 lakhs for a self-occupied property.","IHL112":"Tax benefit for Joint Borrowers: In case of joint home loans, each of the co-borrowers is eligible to receive a total of Rs. 3.5 lakhs (1.5 lakhs under section 80C + 2 lakhs under section 24) as tax exemption. Hence, if a married couple co-signs for a home loan, they can claim a total tax exemption of Rs. 7 lakhs on their home loan.","IHL113":"Q19. What is a top up loan?","IHL114":"If you have an existing home loan and have made timely repayments towards the existing home loan, you may get the option of borrowing an additional loan equal to the amount you have paid off on your current home loan. This is termed as a top up loan. The interest rates on a top up loan are less than a personal loan and it requires little or no paperwork to process this loan and the money can be used for a range of expenses.","IHL115":"Q20. Can I have a co-applicant when I sign up for a home loan?","IHL116":"Yes. You can have a family member like your spouse or your parents co-sign with you when you apply for a home loan. Having a co-signor for your home loan improves your chances of being approved for a larger home loan amount. A co-signor is especially recommended if the primary applicant has a low credit score or has had problems when applying/paying off a loan in the past.","IHL117":"Q21. Is having a good credit record important in case of a home loan?","IHL118":"A home loan is a long term loan (5 to 30 years tenure), hence lenders want to ensure that they will get their money back in the long term. Therefore, the loan sanctioning authority will definitely check your credit history before sanctioning a home loan to you. By having a good credit record/history you would be classified as a low-risk borrower and you may be able to get preferred (low) interest rates and waivers on various bank fees on the basis of your credit history.","IHL119":"Q22. I have low credit score. Can I still apply for a home loan?","IHL120":"In case you have a poor credit score, you will find it difficult to get a home loan. However, you can improve your chances by getting a co-borrower. The co-borrower needs to be a family member like your spouse or parents. Ideally, you should choose a co-borrower who has a regular source of income and good credit history to bolter your chances of a successful application.","IHL121":"Q23. What is pre-EMI Interest?","IHL122":"When banks sanction you a home loan, the EMI payments may not start immediately. In such a situation, the bank is liable to charge a pre-EMI interest on your loan. This interest is payable monthly from the time the loan is disbursed till the time the EMI payments start off. The pre-EMI interest amount is lower than the home loan EMI as the principal payment portion is excluded for pre-EMI interest payments.","IHL123":"Q24. What is the margin on a home loan?","IHL124":"The margin on a home loan refers to the percentage of the cost of the home that is not covered by the lender providing you with the home loan.

Attractiveness of gold as a hedge against inflation and a dependable asset even in times of severity and uncertainty gives it unparalleled value against any other asset class<br/>\\nThere have been demand side factors which are playing the role in determining the price of Gold such as Developing nations over the last 2 decades have accumulated large quantities of Gold reserve and contributed to enhanced demand for gold by Central Banks and institutions. Most demand came from emerging Asian countries as they look to improve their financial stability by investing in gold and growing their reserves. Another prominent use of gold is in the IMF\'s lending policy, wherein IMF allows the borrower country to pay interest due and repay the loan amount in case of dollar reserves shortage. The IMF also used to allow a country to buy a foreign currency from it using gold at predetermined rates. Such importance of gold makes it highly unlikely for any nation to sell off its reserves.<br/><br/>\\nEven from the supply side which is limited to mining of gold has been contributing,Analysis into supply of gold shows that at least 60% of supply in any quarter over the last 40 quarters can be attributed to fresh mining of gold from gold ore.Over the last 5 years, mining costs have been stable and lower than ever before at approximately $350/10gm, hence, the contribution of mining towards supply of fresh gold in the market is strong and stable at more than 70% over the last 5 years.<br/><br/>\\nHowever investors should understand that even though Gold is a safe haven bet there can be slight price fluctuations in the short term and therefore consider global factors before investing.\\n\\n\\n","onlineGoldF26":"Taxation\\n","onlineGoldF27":"Short Term\\r\\n","onlineGoldF28":"Capital gains are levied on investments with a tenure of less than 36 months.

This is because today's money can earn interest between now and then or what you can buy today with the same amount of money may be more expensive in future.<br/>\n                    It is important to know how this concept works for managing your personal finances.<br/>\n                    Let\u2019s say you have INR 1,000 with you. Instead of keeping that money in hand, you decide to deposit that amount in your savings account. Over time, interest adds to this principal amount. As more time passes, both the principal amount and the interest received earn additional interest. This is called compounding interest. In finance terms, this is called the power of compounding.<br/>\n                    If you had kept the money aside instead of depositing it, you would have lost out on the additional income that is earned. Not just that, the buying power of that money would have also been reduced because of changing market factors including inflation. Inflation makes everything expensive in the future. So unless your savings grow in value, you will lose on the real value of the money.<br/><br/>\n                    Consider this:<br/>\n                    If you had a chance to take INR 1,00,000 today instead of taking it next year, which would you choose?<br/>\n                    You would choose to take it today as this money would have more power today as compared to the next year. There are two reasons for this:<br/>\n\n                    1. High purchasing power: Over time as inflation increases, it is safe to consider that INR 1,00,000 will get you more goods and services today as compared to the future.<br/>\n\n                    2. Risks involved: There are always risks involved when it comes to making money in the future. One of the biggest risks is that there is no guarantee that the money that was promised to you would still be available. So wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to have the money in hand today, as compared to the future?<br/><br/>\n\n                    Both the above examples show the time value of money.
