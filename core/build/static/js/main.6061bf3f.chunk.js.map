The price rates of services and goods are never stable in an economy, and it is known as inflation. Due to price inflation, products in the market become costlier. But, when the opposite things happen, we call it deflation. Deflation causes the reduction of services and products. Before creating your investment portfolio, you must learn about inflation. Inflation can affect your returns on investment. A free online inflation calculator can help you to learn about future inflation.<br/> Inflation refers to the continuous rise in the prices of services and goods. It measures the rate of increase in the current rates of some products and services. The purchasing power of a currency starts declining due to inflation. Thus, inflation results in the reduction of the value of your money. Policymakers try to make the prices stable and keep inflation low.\r\n                    Inflation is defined as a percentage. Wholesale Price Index and Consumer Price Index are two concepts relevant to inflation. WPI indicates the variations to the wholesale level price level, whereas CPI is about the effect on the retail level price level. CPI is a highly popular indicator to identify deflation and inflation in the economy. In 2013, CPI replaced WPI in the Indian economy. The difference in the percentage in CPI throughout a period refers to inflation for consumer goods. However, it reveals retail inflation only.

The reason behind it is the increase in price.\r\n\r\n                    For instance, you may have saved Rs. 5,000 today, and the worth of this amount was higher a few years ago. It never denotes the loss of money. But, the purchasing potential of Rs 5,000 after 10 years will be less.\r\n                    The best alternative is to keep money in a financial instrument. The interest will balance out inflammatory effects. But, it will be effective in balancing the loss of inflation.\r\n\r\n                    Based on the type of investment, you need to find the effect of inflation. Bonds and other similar investments give a fixed annual return. You will get a good return for purchasing commodities. However, the value of this return will be low after 4 years.\r\n\r\n                    The effect of inflation in the case of equity investments is miscellaneous. While the inflation rate is high, it indicates a strong economy. Several companies will have good business, and they will pay higher wages. But, they need a higher investment to buy raw materials. It will affect the company’s profit margin.

The principle states that an amount of money that you have in hand has a greater value now than the same amount in the future.<br/>\r\n                    Using a simple tool like a time value of money calculator, it is quite easy to calculate this. A time value of money calculator can help you find the future value of the money you currently hold or current value of the money that you will get in future.<br/>\r\n                    A TVM calculator will help in understanding what will be the value of money you hold today, tomorrow. So how can one calculate the time value of money?\r\n                    `\r\n                }\r\n            ],\r\n            \"Secondbanners\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"Heading\": \"Calculating The Time Value Of Money\",\r\n                    \"Description\": `The concept of the time value of money states that money that you have now is worth more than the same amount of money you will have in the future. This is because today's money can earn interest between now and then or what you can buy today with the same amount of money may be more expensive in future.<br/>\r\n                    It is important to know how this concept works for managing your personal finances.<br/>\r\n                    Let’s say you have INR 1,000 with you. Instead of keeping that money in hand, you decide to deposit that amount in your savings account. Over time, interest adds to this principal amount. As more time passes, both the principal amount and the interest received earn additional interest. This is called compounding interest. In finance terms, this is called the power of compounding.<br/>\r\n                    If you had kept the money aside instead of depositing it, you would have lost out on the additional income that is earned. Not just that, the buying power of that money would have also been reduced because of changing market factors including inflation. Inflation makes everything expensive in the future. So unless your savings grow in value, you will lose on the real value of the money.<br/><br/>\r\n                    Consider this:<br/>\r\n                    If you had a chance to take INR 1,00,000 today instead of taking it next year, which would you choose?<br/>\r\n                    You would choose to take it today as this money would have more power today as compared to the next year. There are two reasons for this:<br/>\r\n\r\n                    1. High purchasing power: Over time as inflation increases, it is safe to consider that INR 1,00,000 will get you more goods and services today as compared to the future.<br/>\r\n\r\n                    2. Risks involved: There are always risks involved when it comes to making money in the future. One of the biggest risks is that there is no guarantee that the money that was promised to you would still be available. So wouldn’t it make more sense to have the money in hand today, as compared to the future?<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n                    Both the above examples show the time value of money. And the time value of the money calculator can show you the future value of the money that you have invested today. <br/>\r\n                    There are a few key components when it comes to the TVM solver calculator: <br/>\r\n                    1. Present value (PV): This is the amount of money we have after applying any discounting rate on the future value<br/>\r\n                    2. Future Value (FV): This is the amount of money we have after applying a compounding rate on the present t value <br/>\r\n                    3. Interest/Discounts (i): This is the rate of discount or compounding applied to the money to calculate the present or future value of money<br/>\r\n                    4. Tenure(t): This is the tenure we want to calculate the present or future value of money. It can be weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, and annually. <br/>\r\n                    5. Compounding year (n): This refers to the number of compounding periods per year.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n                    <b>Build Your Desired Corpus Accurately by using Nivesh’s TVM Calculator.</b>\r\n                    `\r\n                }\r\n\r\n            ],\r\n            \"Thirdbanners\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"Heading\": \"How to use the TVM calculator\",\r\n                    \"Description\": `If you need to know the time value of money, a TVM solver calculator is a good tool to use.

Your future value of money will be:<br/><br/>\r\n                    FV = 10,000x [ 1 + (10% / 1) ] (1 x 1)  <br/>\r\n                    FV= INR 11,000.<br/>\r\n                    Looking at the above, you will need to have the current compounding interest rate as well as the tenure of the investment.<br/>\r\n                    You can also calculate your present value of money by slightly changing the above equation:<br/> <br/>\r\n                    PV= FV / [ 1 + (i / n) ] (n x t)<br/>\r\n                    Using the same values from above:<br/>\r\n                    PV: 11,000/ {1+ (10% / 1) } (1 x 1) <br/>\r\n                    PV= INR 10,000 <br/>\r\n                    When you look at the components that are involved in the time value of a money calculator, you have to consider that the effect of the compounding period has on the calculations.
