But, in the pandemic years, the cause of inflation can be complicated due to the response from the government. However, we have listed the most common causes of inflation.<br/>\n\n                    <b>Demand-pull inflation:</B>\n                    While the aggregate demand for some services and products is higher than the aggregate supply in the economy, it results in demand-pull inflation.\n                    Demand can be higher than supply, and it causes the price to move upward.<br/>\n\n                    <b>Cost-push inflation:</b>\n                    While the cost of materials and wages is on the rise, we call it cost-push inflation. An organization having the capabilities of creating a monopoly will be one of the contributors to cost-push inflation.<br/>\n\n                    <b>Higher money supply:</b>\n\n                    The total monetary amount in circulation is related to the increased money supply. It includes coins, cash, bank accounts, and balances. While there is a faster increase in the money supply, it can cause inflation.  A high amount of products can chase too few products. <br/>\n\n                    <b>Devaluation:</b>\n                    It refers to the downward adjustment in the exchange rate of the country. It will reduce the values of the currency. The currency's devaluation will make exports less expensive. It will encourage foreign countries to purchase devalued products. Devaluation will make these foreign goods costlier. Consumers of the devaluing nation will purchase domestic goods and not the imported ones.<br/>\n\n                   <b>The rise in salary:</b>\n                    Wages are included in the production costs. When there is a rise in wages, businesses will have lower margins.  They will balance the higher productivity and wage growth.\n                    Due to the increasing wages, consumers will be able to pay a higher amount without affecting their purchasing potentials.<br/>\n\n                    <b>Regulations and policies:</b>\n\n                    Some policies are responsible for demand-pull and cost-push inflation. While there are tax subsidies for some goods, there will be a rise in demand. There will be a rise in cost when there is a higher demand. Moreover, stringent regulations and rent stabilization rules will cause a rise in costs. The overall economic environment will be inflationary.<br/>\n\n                    Several other factors can be the cause of inflation-\n\n                    <li>Technology,</li>\n                    <li>Velocity of money</li>\n                    <li>Demographic trends</li>\n                    <li>Unemployment rate,</li>\n                    <li>Savings rate</li>\n                    <li>Debt to income ratios,</li>\n                    The level of impact of these factors can be different.\n                    Inflation is one of the parts of any economy. When everything is normal, it indicates less value of the money each year. Make sure that you are adjusting your living standards to inflation."},{Heading:"4.

This is because today's money can earn interest between now and then or what you can buy today with the same amount of money may be more expensive in future.<br/>\n                    It is important to know how this concept works for managing your personal finances.<br/>\n                    Let\u2019s say you have INR 1,000 with you. Instead of keeping that money in hand, you decide to deposit that amount in your savings account. Over time, interest adds to this principal amount. As more time passes, both the principal amount and the interest received earn additional interest. This is called compounding interest. In finance terms, this is called the power of compounding.<br/>\n                    If you had kept the money aside instead of depositing it, you would have lost out on the additional income that is earned. Not just that, the buying power of that money would have also been reduced because of changing market factors including inflation. Inflation makes everything expensive in the future. So unless your savings grow in value, you will lose on the real value of the money.<br/><br/>\n                    Consider this:<br/>\n                    If you had a chance to take INR 1,00,000 today instead of taking it next year, which would you choose?<br/>\n                    You would choose to take it today as this money would have more power today as compared to the next year. There are two reasons for this:<br/>\n\n                    1. High purchasing power: Over time as inflation increases, it is safe to consider that INR 1,00,000 will get you more goods and services today as compared to the future.<br/>\n\n                    2. Risks involved: There are always risks involved when it comes to making money in the future. One of the biggest risks is that there is no guarantee that the money that was promised to you would still be available. So wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to have the money in hand today, as compared to the future?<br/><br/>\n\n                    Both the above examples show the time value of money.
