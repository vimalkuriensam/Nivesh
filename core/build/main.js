What is the Tenure of a Home Loan?","IHL53":"Home Loans are long term borrowing instruments with a minimum tenure of 5 years and a maximum tenure of 30 years. The tenure offered to you for your personal loan depends on the loan amount that is sanctioned to you by the lender along with other factors.","IHL54":"3.

What do Banks Consider when Granting a Home Loan?","IHL64":"Once repayment capacity determines your eligibility to apply for home loan, lenders consider the following factors:","IHL65":"Income level of the applicant","IHL66":"Age of the applicant","IHL67":"Qualification (stability and occupation continuity)","IHL68":"Resident status (maximum limit for an Indian Resident differs from that of a Non-Resident)","IHL69":"Spouse’s income (household income is taken into account when there is a co-applicant)","IHL70":"No. of dependants (it is a measure of repayment capacity)","IHL71":"Credit history and score (past repayment track record)","IHL72":"Status of existing loans","IHL73":"6. Can I Apply for a Joint Loan with My Friend?","IHL74":"No. A lender would only allow you to apply for a joint Home Loan if the application is co-signed by one or more members of your immediate family. Thus, your friend does not qualify.","IHL75":"7. Who can be Joint Borrowers in Case of a Home Loan?","IHL76":"Immediate family members such as your parents, spouse and children are allowed to be joint borrowers in case of a Home Loan.","IHL77":"8. What is the Maximum Number of Joint Borrowers for a Home Loan?","IHL78":"The maximum number of joint borrowers in case of a Home Loan is fixed at 6. However, only family members such as parents, siblings and spouse can be co-borrowers for a Home Loan in India. Additionally, having a co-borrower who has a robust credit history and good credit score is preferable as compared to one with a low credit score.","IHL79":"9. What is a Floating Rate Home Loan?","IHL80":"If the interest rate on the loan varies periodically over the loan tenure, then it is called a floating rate Home Loan. Lenders have their own base rate which determines the rate of interest charged on a Home Loan. The base rates of banks are revised from time to time based on RBI directives as well as other factors, which leads to an increase or decrease in the EMI amount payable.","IHL81":"10. What is a Fixed Rate Home Loan?","IHL82":"Fixed Rate Home Loans are offered at a predetermined interest rate during the loan period and these remain unchanged during the loan period irrespective of market conditions. This can be a huge benefit when market volatility starts affecting interest rates. For instance, if the RBI increases interest rates on loans, then people with fixed rate Home Loan will not be affected by any increase or decrease in the market interest rates and the EMI amount will remain unchanged. This type of Home Loan is less popular these days.","IHL83":"11. How is the RLLR Method Going to Affect My Current Home Loan?","IHL84":"As per recently updated RBI rules, banks are required to use the RLLR (Repo linked lending rate) method to determine the interest rate on Home Loans. In case of a floating rate Home Loan, the banks are now required to change the interest rate either yearly or every six months. In case you have a fixed rate Home Loan, you can get in touch with your bank to get information regarding the conversion of your fixed rate Home Loan to the new RRLR-based floating interest rate. At present, the introduction of the new RRLR regime has led to a reduction in applicable Home Loan interest rates.","IHL85":"12. Can I Switch from a Floating Rate Home Loan to a Fixed Rate?","IHL86":"Yes. A few lenders do offer you the option of switching from a floating rate to a fixed rate Home Loan and the other way around. However, this is not applicable to all home loans and there are a few charges involved in implementing this conversion. Get in touch with your lender to get details regarding the procedure and requirements.","IHL87":"13. How do I Repay My Home Loan?","IHL88":"There are different ways to pay off your loan such as issuing post-dated cheques for the tenure of the Home Loan, getting the amount deducted automatically from your salary or by issuing standard instructions to the lender for ECS (Electronic Clearing System) wherein the EMI is automatically deducted from your bank every month.","IHL89":"14. Should I Apply for a Home Loan with a Public or Private Bank?","IHL90":"Before zeroing in on a Home Loan, it is best to compare the various interest rates that would be applicable to you. When you apply for a Home Loan through Nivesh, you get the opportunity to apply for a Home Loan through both private and public-sector banks. Also, take into account, the fact that banks charge various processing and other related fees when you apply for a Home Loan and you should also consider these when applying for a Home Loan.","IHL91":"15. Is Prepayment of Home Loan Allowed?","IHL92":"Yes, one can repay the loan amount before completion of the scheduled loan tenure by making a lump sum payment towards paying off the loan. In such cases, the bank may decide to apply some penalties in the range of 2-3% of the principal amount outstanding. Some banks and NBFC (non-banking financial companies) do not charge any penalty on prepayment of a Home Loan.","IHL93":"16. What are the Key Charges Associated with a Home Loan Process?","IHL94":"Processing Fee- When applying for a loan, a fee is paid to the lender known as processing fee. The amount paid could be either a percentage of the loan amount or a fixed amount that is paid in lieu of carrying out the loan sanction formalities.","IHL95":"Commitment Fee- It is essential to avail the loan within a stipulated time period after it is processed and sanctioned otherwise some financial institutions levy a commitment fee. By paying the commitment fee, you are assured that you can access the loan at the interest rate and for the tenure that was initially agreed on. Most banks no longer charge this fee.","IHL96":"Pre-payment Charges- Banks/ financial institutions might charge a penalty if the entire loan amount is paid off before completion of the loan tenure. The penalty amount also known as foreclosure/pre-payment charges could be a maximum of 5% of the loan amount that is paid off before the completion of loan tenure.","IHL97":"Miscellaneous Charges- Documentation, stamp duty, credit bureau report issuance charges and consultant charges are generally considered as miscellaneous charges by few lenders.","IHL98":"17. What Documents do I Need to Submit with My Home Loan Application?","IHL99":"The documents that need to be submitted may vary from one lender to the other. Some of the necessary documents to be submitted include the following-","IHL100":"Completed loan application form","IHL101":"Passport size photographs","IHL102":"Identity proof – PAN card/Passport/ DL/ Voters ID","IHL103":"Residence proof- telephone or electricity bill/ passport/ voter ID / property tax receipt","IHL104":"Bank statement for at least past 6 months and salary certificates/ latest acknowledged ITR","IHL105":"Copy of plan approved for the proposed construction/extension","IHL106":"Cost estimation/ valuation report from Bank’s (or finance company) authorised surveyor/evaluator.","IHL107":"Allotment letter of housing board/ NOC of the society/Builder etc. as well as any other land use certificate/other","IHL108":"18. Is there any Tax Benefit Available on Home Loans?","IHL109":"The tax benefit on home loan is divided into two sections-","IHL110":"Tax exemption on repayment of the Home Loan principal: This is the deduction allowed under Tax Section 80C with a maximum annual tax deduction of Rs. 150,000 under the section.","IHL111":"Tax benefit on the interest rate for a Home Loan: Under Section 24 of the Income Tax Act, you can avail the tax benefit on the amount of interest paid on a Home Loan to the maximum limit of Rs. 2 Lakhs for a self-occupied property.","IHL112":"Tax Benefit for Joint Borrowers: In case of joint Home Loans, each of the co-borrowers is eligible to receive a total of Rs. 3.5 Lakhs (Rs. 1.5 Lakhs under section 80C + Rs. 2 Lakhs under section 24) as tax exemption. Hence, if a married couple co-signs for a home loan, they can claim a total tax exemption of Rs. 7 Lakhs on their Home Loan.","IHL113":"19. What is a Top Up Loan?","IHL114":"If you have an existing Home Loan and have made timely repayments towards the existing Home Loan, you may get the option of borrowing an additional loan equal to the amount you have paid off on your current home loan. This is termed as a top up loan. The interest rates on a top up loan are less than a personal loan and it requires little or no paperwork to process this loan and the money can be used for a range of expenses.","IHL115":"20. Can I have a Co-applicant when I Sign Up for a Home Loan?","IHL116":"Yes. You can have a family member like your spouse or your parents co-sign with you when you apply for a Home Loan. Having a co-signor for your home loan improves your chances of being approved for a larger home loan amount. A co-signor is especially recommended if the primary applicant has a low credit score or has had problems when applying/paying off a loan in the past.","IHL117":"21. Is Having a Good Credit Record Important in Case of a Home Loan?","IHL118":"A Home Loan is a long term loan (5 to 30 years tenure), hence lenders want to ensure that they will get their money back in the long term. Therefore, the loan sanctioning authority will definitely check your credit history before sanctioning a home loan to you. By having a good credit record/history you would be classified as a low-risk borrower and you may be able to get preferred (low) interest rates and waivers on various bank fees on the basis of your credit history.","IHL119":"22. I have Low Credit Score. Can I Still Apply for a Home Loan?","IHL120":"In case you have a poor credit score, you will find it difficult to get a Home Loan. However, you can improve your chances by getting a co-borrower. The co-borrower needs to be a family member like your spouse or parents. Ideally, you should choose a co-borrower who has a regular source of income and good credit history to bolter your chances of a successful application.","IHL121":"23. What is Pre-EMI Interest?","IHL122":"When banks sanction you a home loan, the EMI payments may not start immediately. In such a situation, the bank is liable to charge a pre-EMI interest on your loan. This interest is payable monthly from the time the loan is disbursed till the time the EMI payments start off. The pre-EMI interest amount is lower than the home loan EMI as the principal payment portion is excluded for pre-EMI interest payments.","IHL123":"24. What is the Margin on a Home Loan?","IHL124":"The margin on a Home Loan refers to the percentage of the cost of the home that is not covered by the lender providing you with the home loan. On average, lenders implement a 20% margin on Home Loans i.e. the Home Loan amount sanctioned to you will be 80% of the actual cost of the property. The remaining 20% of the Home Loan cost will have to be borne by you. Though the 20% margin is the industry average, lenders may increase or decrease their home loan margins on a case by case basis.","IHL125":"25.

They can use these funds as a gateway to ease into the riskier funds.<br/>\\nAmateur investors should be very cautious while investing in such funds and consider safer and more liquid money market instruments such as Debt Funds, if their risk appetite so dictates.","HMF51":"","HMF52":"","HMF53":"2. Are Hybrid Funds High Risk?","HMF54":"","HMF55":"Hybrid Mutual Funds can vary in their risk factor as per their asset allocation, those funds with a higher equity exposure will carry higher risk such as Aggressive Hybrid Funds.<br/>\\nHybrid Mutual Funds should be smartly picked, keeping in mind certain factors such as expense ratio, asset allocation, diversification and correlation, which all play a role in defining a risk profile.","HMF56":"","HMF57":"","HMF58":"3. What Kind of Returns can I Earn from Hybrid Funds?","HMF59":"","HMF60":"Hybrid Mutual Funds can be of different risk profiles with varying features. This means there are no guaranteed returns. The returns are as volatile as the underlying assets, the time horizon under consideration, the number of times that fund gets restructured within specified limits and the resilience of the fund as a whole, all play a part in determining the returns from the funds.<br/>\\nWhile a Conservative Hybrid Fund may have a medium risk profile given the high proportion of money market instruments than equity assets with 10-12% returns in a 3-year horizon, an Aggressive Hybrid Fund could be predominantly Equity Mutual Fund with quite a high-risk profile and as the name suggests, may yield high returns however these returns would be lower than a pure Equity Fund in a 3-year horizon.","HMF61":"","HMF62":"4. How to Evaluate the Best Hybrid Funds?","HMF63":"Hybrid funds can be evaluated based on their types and matching it with the investor’s financial goals, risk appetite and investment horizon. There can be many types of a Hybrid Mutual Fund, implementing different trading strategies:<br/><br/>\\nArbitrage Fund – These funds use the arbitrage strategy to exploit the differential in the price of an asset between cash and derivative markets. These funds are predominantly equity funds, meaning 65% of the asset allocation is to equities and the remaining is in debt instruments. These are the least risky of all the funds, and so are highly liquid instruments.<br/><br/>\\nConservative Hybrid Fund – As the name itself suggests, these funds invest only a small portion of 10% to 25% in the equity segment, while the chunk of investment of 75% to 90% is in the debt securities. These are extremely safe and risk-free investments, which focus on stable returns with capital preservation.<br/><br/>\\nEquity Savings Fund – These are taxed as equity funds as they invest a minimum of 65% of the capital in equity assets while diversifying a minimum of 10% of the capital in debt securities to target both capital appreciation as well as revenue generation. The exposure from the equity segment is hedged with debt instruments to cushion the risk.<br/><br/>\\nDynamic Asset Allocation Fund – These are also known as Balanced Advantage Funds, as the fund managers change the asset allocation as per the market conditions to reap the most advantage. The investors choosing this fund should have a moderately high-risk appetite and the investment horizon should also be up to 5 years. Say for example equity prices are low, then the fund manager will invest more in equities aiming at capital appreciation while buying the stocks at low valuations, and the opposite if the equity prices are too high. These are usually taxed as equity funds, but the investors should always check the scheme information document (SID) thoroughly before investing.<br/><br/>\\nMulti-Asset Fund – The basic philosophy behind these funds is to replicate a fully diversified portfolio of investments through one product, by investing in multiple assets across the class with a minimum of 3 asset classes. Investors who do not want to manage their portfolios themselves and maintain a diversified risk profile should opt for such funds.<br/><br/>\\nAggressive Hybrid Fund – These are also known as hybrid equity mutual funds owing to the high asset allocation to equity or equity-related instruments to the tune of up to 80%, the minimum requirement being 65%. The remaining is invested in debt instruments. Given the high portion of investment in equities, these are also taxed as equity funds and often lead to capital appreciation if held for the medium term.","HMF70":"5. How Long Should I Stay Invested in Hybrid Funds?","HMF71":"Hybrid Mutual Funds act as a gateway for investors who want to venture into the market. There are many different types of Hybrid Mutual Funds which are composed to match the investment goals of the investors and their varying risk profiles, trading strategies or preferences. Depending on all of these features, and factoring in the ever-changing market conditions, these funds can be held for different time horizons which again have varying rolling returns. The historical returns data can be checked from the SID.","HMF72":"6. Tax Implications of Investing in Hybrid Funds?","HMF73":"Hybrid Mutual Funds are taxable funds. These funds need to be classified as equity oriented or debt-oriented to better understand their taxation. Hybrid funds with more than 65% equity allocation are classified as Equity-Oriented Funds, rest are classified as Debt-Oriented. Now let us understand their taxation:<br/>\\n<b>Capital Gains:</b><br/>\\nShort Term Capital Gain (STCG) is capital gain that arises on securities which are sold within a year of their acquisition for equity orientated funds and within 3 years for Debt Orientated Funds. Such gains are taxed at 15% for Equity-Oriented Fund and at normal income tax slab rates as for Debt-Oriented Funds.<br/>\\nThe gains which are not short-term, are classified as Long-Term Capital Gain (LTCG). Tax rates are:\\n<ul>\\n<li>For Equity Orientated Funds: 10% without indexation benefits over and above the profits of Rs. 1 Lakh in a financial year. </li>\\n<li>For Debt Orientated Funds: 20% with indexation. Indexation is a mechanism to bring the purchase cost of securities at par with their current market value by adjusting for inflation factor.</li>\\n</ul>","HMF79":"Who Should Invest in a Hybrid Fund?","HMF80":"A Hybrid Mutual Fund is a very safe investment option for certain investors, given they have a clear view of their targeted returns.A Hybrid Mutual Fund is a very safe investment option for certain investors, given they have a clear view of their targeted returns.\\r\\n\\r\\n","HMF81":"Hybrid funds are most suitable for an investor with a medium risk appetite.

Inflation has two major effects on your savings-<br/>\\n<ul>\\n<li>It lowers the purchasing capacity</li>\\n<li>It increases your future financial needs</li>\\n</ul>\\nInflation makes goods and services costlier. In due course, it will decrease the value of your financial savings. The reason behind it is the increase in price. For instance, you may have saved Rs. 5,000 today, the worth of this amount was higher a few years ago as due to lower prices more goods and services could be purchased. It never denotes the loss of money. However, the purchasing potential of Rs. 5,000 after 10 years will be less due to rising prices. The best alternative is to keep money in a financial instrument. The interest will balance out inflationary effects. However, it will be effective in balancing the loss due to inflation. Based on the type of investment, you need to find the effect of inflation. Bonds and other similar investments give a fixed annual return. You will get a good return for purchasing commodities. However, the value of this return will be low after 4 years. The effect of inflation in the case of equity investments is miscellaneous. While the inflation rate is high, it indicates a strong economy. Several companies will have good business, and they will pay higher wages. However, they need a higher investment to buy raw materials. It will affect the company’s profit margin. Thus, the company’s overall performance is related to the inflationary effects.","inflation15":"Different Ways Inflation Shows its Effects","inflation16":"Cost of your living- From housing to health care, everything will have be effected due to inflation.","inflation17":"Salary- Some workers find a positive effect of inflation.

What are the Potential Causes of Inflation?","inflation45":"Several factors can contribute to inflation. But, in the pandemic years, the cause of inflation can be complicated due to the response from the government. However, we have listed the most common causes of inflation.","inflation46":"Demand-pull inflation: While the aggregate demand for some services and products is higher than the aggregate supply in the economy, it results in demand-pull inflation. Demand can be higher than supply, and it causes the price to move upward.","inflation47":"Cost-push inflation: While the cost of materials and wages is on the rise, we call it cost-push inflation. An organization having the capabilities of creating a monopoly will be one of the contributors to cost-push inflation.","inflation48":"Higher money supply: The total monetary amount in circulation is related to the increased money supply. It includes coins, cash, bank accounts, and balances. While there is a faster increase in the money supply, it can cause inflation. A high amount of products can chase too few products.","inflation49":"Devaluation: It refers to the downward adjustment in the exchange rate of the country. It will reduce the values of the currency. The currency\'s devaluation will make exports less expensive. It will encourage foreign countries to purchase devalued products. Devaluation will make these foreign goods costlier. Consumers of the devaluing nation will purchase domestic goods and not the imported ones.","inflation50":"The rise in salary: Wages are included in the production costs. When there is a rise in wages, businesses will have lower margins. They will balance the higher productivity and wage growth. Due to the increasing wages, consumers will be able to pay a higher amount without affecting their purchasing potentials.","inflation51":"Regulations and policies: Some policies are responsible for demand-pull and cost-push inflation. While there are tax subsidies for some goods, there will be a rise in demand. There will be a rise in cost when there is a higher demand. Moreover, stringent regulations and rent stabilization rules will cause a rise in costs. The overall economic environment will be inflationary.","inflation52":"Several other factors can be the cause of inflation:<br/>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Technology</li>\\n<li>Velocity of money</li>\\n<li>Demographic trends</li>\\n<li>Unemployment rate</li>\\n<li>Savings rate</li>\\n<li>Debt to income ratios</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n","inflation54":"The level of impact of these factors can be different. Inflation is one of the parts of any economy. When everything is normal, it indicates less value of the money each year. Make sure that you are adjusting your living standards to inflation.","inflation55":"4. What are the Ways of Preventing Inflation?","inflation56":"The major strategy to avoid inflation is to amend the monetary policy and adjust the interest rate. You can find a lower demand and higher interest rate. Simultaneously, a lower interest rate will result in higher demand. There are some other ways of preventing the inflation rate.<br/>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Control the money supply and prevent inflation. The rate of money supply indicates how much money is circulated throughout the country. The RBI is responsible for controlling the money supply.</li>\\n                    <li>A higher rate of income tax will lower the expenditure, and it will avoid inflationary pressures.</li>\\n                    <li>It is important to introduce policies to make the economy more efficient and reduce long-term costs.</li>\\n</ul>"}')},80154:function(e){"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"IOIAMI1":"Invest Online in Invesco Asset Management India Pvt Ltd Portfolio Management Services (PMS) With Nivesh","IOIAMI2":"Invesco Asset Management’s Portfolio Management Service is catered to individuals who wish to generate high returns while generating capital appreciation as well.

A minimum of 65% of the portfolio is required to be invested in equity and equity-related instruments. The returns that can be made are largely dependent on how the stock market performs within a particular time frame. The rest of the investment can be made into debt securities or kept in cash.\\n<br/><br/>\\nThe best Mid-cap Mutual Funds to invest in are those that always pick those stocks with strong fundamentals such as those companies with robust management systems, sound financials, etc. The investment is made in companies that are ranked 101st to 250th in terms of market capitalisation with the aim of diversification. The fund managers of top Mid-cap Mutual Funds invest in stocks of underlying companies that have the potential of great growth in the future. This happens because the companies under Mid-cap capitalization in the market are much more volatile and have a better scope of growth as compared to Large-cap Funds during bullish phases of the market. The presumption behind such investment is that only a fundamentally strong company would earn good profits thereby allowing for growth and return on investment.\\n<br/><br/>\\nThe best performing Mid-cap Mutual Funds thus enable investors to beat the returns offered by Large-cap companies during bullish phases of the market. Thus any lucrative investment opportunities are taken advantage of, before the companies under Mid-cap can evolve into Large-cap companies of future. This is particularly great since it enables investors to manage risk and reward and invest accordingly to earn great returns.","midCapF33":"Who Should Invest in Mid-cap Mutual Funds?","midCapF34":"The Mid-cap Funds have a higher risk associated with them in comparison with debt funds or Large-cap funds.

Are Mid-cap Funds High Risk?","midCapF41":"Mid-cap Funds put majority of investment in equity and equity-related instruments. Thus they are relatively high-risk investments and only suitable for investors willing to bet on stock market performance. Since investment is made in Mid-cap companies to earn great returns one should always keep in mind that there is always a chance that the companies under this capitalisation may plunge further during bearish market phases due to higher volatility than large cap funds. The risk can be reduced by investing in systematic investment plans (SIPs), and the time of such investment should at least be 5 years.","midCapF42":"2. What Kind of Returns can I Earn from the Best Mid-cap Mutual Funds?","midCapF43":"The stock market is always uncertain, and thus no one can predict future gains in Equity Funds. Gains are also influenced by the companies chosen by the fund manager. Nevertheless, based on previous performance, if you were to invest for more than 5 years, a compounded annual growth rate of 12-15%, if the economy keeps growing at an average of 7% per annum.","midCapF44":"3.

However, long term capital gains of up to Rs. 1 Lakh in a year are exempted from taxation. If any capital gain is made by selling stocks within one year then the return is taxed at 15% and classified as short term capital gains.

The principle states that an amount of money that you have in hand has a greater value now than the same amount in the future.<br/>\\nUsing a simple tool like a time value of money calculator, it is quite easy to calculate this. A time value of money calculator can help you find the future value of the money you currently hold or current value of the money that you will get in future.<br/>\\nA TVM calculator will help in understanding what will be the value of money you hold today, tomorrow. So how can one calculate the time value of money?","TVM5":"Calculating the Time Value Of Money","TVM6":"The concept of the time value of money states that money that you have now is worth more than the same amount of money you will have in the future. This is because today\'s money can earn interest between now and then or what you can buy today with the same amount of money may be more expensive in future.<br/>\\nIt is important to know how this concept works for managing your personal finances.<br/>\\nLet’s say you have INR 1,000 with you. Instead of keeping that money in hand, you decide to deposit that amount in your savings account. Over time, interest adds to this principal amount. As more time passes, both the principal amount and the interest received earn additional interest. This is called compounding interest. In finance terms, this is called the power of compounding.<br/>\\nIf you had kept the money aside instead of depositing it, you would have lost out on the additional income that is earned. Not just that, the buying power of that money would have also been reduced because of changing market factors including inflation. Inflation makes everything expensive in the future. So unless your savings grow in value, you will lose on the real value of the money.<br/><br/>\\n\\n<b>Consider this:</b><br/>\\n If you had a chance to take INR 1,00,000 today instead of taking it next year, which would you choose?<br/>\\n                    You would choose to take it today as this money would have more power today as compared to the next year. There are two reasons for this:<br/>\\n\\n                    1. High purchasing power: Over time as inflation increases, it is safe to consider that INR 1,00,000 will get you more goods and services today as compared to the future.<br/>\\n\\n                    2. Risks involved: There are always risks involved when it comes to making money in the future. One of the biggest risks is that there is no guarantee that the money that was promised to you would still be available. So wouldn’t it make more sense to have the money in hand today, as compared to the future?<br/><br/>\\n\\n                    Both the above examples show the time value of money. And the time value of the money calculator can show you the future value of the money that you have invested today. <br/>\\n                    There are a few key components when it comes to the TVM solver calculator: <br/>\\n                    1. Present value (PV): This is the amount of money we have after applying any discounting rate on the future value<br/>\\n                    2. Future Value (FV): This is the amount of money we have after applying a compounding rate on the present t value <br/>\\n                    3. Interest/Discounts (i): This is the rate of discount or compounding applied to the money to calculate the present or future value of money<br/>\\n                    4. Tenure(t): This is the tenure we want to calculate the present or future value of money. It can be weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, and annually. <br/>\\n                    5. Compounding year (n): This refers to the number of compounding periods per year.","TVM18":"Build Your Desired Corpus Accurately by using Nivesh’s TVM Calculator.","TVM19":"How to use the TVM calculator","TVM20":"If you need to know the time value of money, a TVM solver calculator is a good tool to use.

Your future value of money will be:<br/><br/>\\n                    FV = 10,000x [ 1 + (10% / 1) ] (1 x 1)  <br/>\\n                    FV= INR 11,000.<br/>\\n                    Looking at the above, you will need to have the current compounding interest rate as well as the tenure of the investment.<br/>\\n                    You can also calculate your present value of money by slightly changing the above equation:<br/> <br/>\\n                    PV= FV / [ 1 + (i / n) ] (n x t)<br/>\\n                    Using the same values from above:<br/>\\n                    PV: 11,000/ {1+ (10% / 1) } (1 x 1) <br/>\\n                    PV= INR 10,000 <br/>\\n                    When you look at the components that are involved in the time value of a money calculator, you have to consider that the effect of the compounding period has on the calculations. Compounding periods can be daily, monthly, or quarterly depending on the type of investment. <br/>\\n                    When the compounding period changes, the future value of money will also change. <br/>\\n                    <ul>\\n                        <li>Daily Compounding: FV = INR 10,000 x [1 + (10% / 365)] ^ (365 x 1) = INR 11,052 </li>\\n                        <li>Monthly Compounding: FV = INR10,000 x [1 + (10% / 12)] ^ (12 x 1) = INR 11,047</li>\\n                        <li>Quarterly Compounding: FV = INR 10,000 x [1 + (10% / 4)] ^ (4 x 1) = INR 11,038</li>\\n                    </ul>\\n                    The above example shows that the time value of money not only depends on the interest and the tenure but also the number of times the compounding calculations are done.","TVM40":"What can the TVM formula calculator solve?","TVM41":"Using a TVM solver calculator can assist in making better investment decisions.         While the formula informs the present and future value of money, this TVM online calculator can be used to understand the other variable factors as well. <br/>\\n                    The TVM calculator can also solve the value of each payment in a compounding period, the number of periods as well as the rate of interest. <br/>\\n                    Apart from the above, you can also use the TVM calculator for understanding the below:\\n                    <ul>\\n                        <li><b>Future value of an annuity:</b> Annuity is the constant cash flow on an investment.

If you want to calculate the future value of your annuity, your above TVM formula changes to accommodate the years of investment. If you invest INR 1000 for 5 years with a 10% ROI, your future value of the annuity will be INR 6105</li>\\n                        <li><b>Present Value of Annuity:</b> This concept is the reversal of the future value of the annuity. Since the focus is on present value, you will factor the future value of money along with the tenure and rate of interest.

किसी व्यक्ति को विशेष रूप से आवासीय संपत्ति खरीदने के लिए दिया गया ऋण है। यहां, ऋणदाता संपत्ति का शीर्षक तब तक रखता है जब तक कि ऋण ब्याज सहित पूरी तरह से वापस नहीं किया जाता है।","IHL52":"2. होम लोन की अवधि क्या है?","IHL53":"होम लोन लंबी अवधि के उधार साधन हैं जिनकी न्यूनतम अवधि 5 वर्ष और अधिकतम अवधि 30 वर्ष है। आपके व्यक्तिगत ऋण के लिए आपको दी जाने वाली अवधि ऋण की राशि पर निर्भर करती है जो अन्य कारकों के साथ ऋणदाता द्वारा आपको स्वीकृत की जाती है।","IHL54":"3. होम लोन के लिए पात्रता मानदंड क्या है?","IHL55":"कोई भी - चाहे स्व-नियोजित हो या वेतनभोगी व्यक्ति / पेशेवर - आय के नियमित स्रोत के साथ होम लोन के लिए आवेदन कर सकता है। ऋण की अवधि शुरू होने पर कम से कम 21 वर्ष का होना चाहिए और ऋण समाप्त होने पर या रिटायरमेंट के समय 65 वर्ष से अधिक नहीं होना चाहिए। यह सामान्य होम लोन पात्रता मानदंड है और न्यूनतम और अधिकतम आयु सीमा, न्यूनतम आय स्तर आदि जैसी बारीकियां एक ऋणदाता से दूसरे में भिन्न हो सकती हैं।","IHL56":"4. मुझे निवेश में होम लोन के लिए आवेदन क्यों करना चाहिए?","IHL57":"जब आप निवेश के होम लोन सेक्शन में लॉग इन करते हैं, तो आप कुछ महत्वपूर्ण स्टेपों का पालन करके मिनटों में किफायती आवास ऋण के लिए आवेदन कर सकते हैं:","IHL58":"उन विभिन्न उधारदाताओं का पता लगाएं, जो आपके द्वारा प्रदान

बच जाती है।","IHL63":"5. होम लोन देते समय बैंक किन बातों का ध्यान रखते हैं?","IHL64":"एक बार चुकौती क्षमता होम लोन के लिए आवेदन करने के लिए आपकी योग्यता निर्धारित करती है, तो ऋणदाता निम्नलिखित कारकों पर विचार करते हैं:","IHL65":"आवेदक का आय स्तर","IHL66":"आवेदक की आयु","IHL67":"योग्यता (स्थिरता और व्यवसाय निरंतरता)","IHL68":"निवासी की स्थिति (एक भारतीय निवासी के लिए अधिकतम सीमा एक अनिवासी से भिन्न होती है)","IHL69":"जीवनसाथी की आय (सह-आवेदक होने पर घरेलू आय को ध्यान में रखा जाता है)","IHL70":"आश्रितों की संख्या (यह चुकौती क्षमता का एक उपाय है)","IHL71":"क्रेडिट इतिहास और स्कोर (पिछले चुकौती ट्रैक रिकॉर्ड)","IHL72":"मौजूदा ऋणों की स्थिति","IHL73":"6. क्या मैं अपने मित्र के साथ संयुक्त लोन के लिए आवेदन कर सकता हूँ?","IHL74":"नहीं। एक ऋणदाता आपको केवल संयुक्त होम लोन के लिए आवेदन करने की अनुमति तभी देगा यदि आवेदन आपके तत्काल परिवार के एक या अधिक सदस्यों द्वारा सह-हस्ताक्षरित है। इस प्रकार, आपका मित्र योग्य नहीं है।","IHL75":"7. होम लोन के मामले में संयुक्त उधारकर्ता कौन हो सकते हैं?","IHL76":"होम लोन के मामले में परिवार के तत्काल सदस्यों जैसे आपके माता-पिता, पति या पत्नी और बच्चों को संयुक्त उधारकर्ता बनने की अनुमति है।","IHL77":"8. होम लोन के लिए संयुक्त उधारकर्ताओं की अधिकतम संख्या कितनी है?","IHL78":"होम लोन के मामले में संयुक्त उधारकर्ताओं की अधिकतम संख्या 6 तय की गई है। हालांकि, केवल परिवार के सदस्य जैसे माता-पिता, भाई-बहन और पति या पत्नी ही भारत में होम लोन के लिए सह-उधारकर्ता हो सकते हैं। इसके अतिरिक्त, एक सह-उधारकर्ता जिसका क्रेडिट इतिहास मजबूत और अच्छा क्रेडिट स्कोर है, कम क्रेडिट स्कोर वाले व्यक्ति की तुलना में बेहतर है।","IHL79":"9. फ्लोटिंग रेट होम लोन क्या है?","IHL80":"यदि लोन पर ब्याज दर समय-समय पर लोन अवधि के दौरान बदलती रहती है, तो इसे फ्लोटिंग रेट होम लोन कहा जाता है। उधारदाताओं की अपनी आधार दर होती है जो गृह ऋण पर लगाए गए ब्याज की दर निर्धारित करती है। आरबीआई के निर्देशों के साथ-साथ अन्य कारकों के आधार पर बैंकों की आधार दरों को समय-समय पर संशोधित किया जाता है, जिससे देय ईएमआई राशि में वृद्धि या कमी होती है।","IHL81":"10. फिक्स्ड रेट होम लोन क्या है?","IHL82":"फिक्स्ड रेट होम लोन, लोन अवधि के दौरान एक पूर्व निर्धारित ब्याज दर पर पेश किए जाते हैं और ये बाजार की स्थितियों के बावजूद लोन अवधि के दौरान अपरिवर्तित रहते हैं। यह एक बड़ा लाभ हो सकता है जब बाजार की अस्थिरता ब्याज दरों को प्रभावित करना शुरू कर दे। उदाहरण के लिए, यदि आरबीआई ऋणों पर ब्याज दरों में वृद्धि करता है, तो निश्चित दर गृह ऋण वाले लोग बाजार ब्याज दरों में किसी भी वृद्धि या कमी से प्रभावित नहीं होंगे और ईएमआई राशि अपरिवर्तित रहेगी। इस प्रकार का होम लोन इन दिनों कम लोकप्रिय है।","IHL83":"11. RLLR पद्धति मेरे वर्तमान होम लोन को कैसे प्रभावित करेगी?","IHL84":"हाल ही में अपडेट किए गए आरबीआई नियमों के अनुसार, बैंकों को होम लोन पर ब्याज दर निर्धारित करने के लिए आरएलएलआर (रेपो लिंक्ड लेंडिंग रेट) पद्धति का उपयोग करना आवश्यक है। फ्लोटिंग रेट होम लोन के मामले में, बैंकों को अब ब्याज दर को सालाना या हर छह महीने में बदलना होगा। यदि आपके पास एक निश्चित दर गृह ऋण है, तो आप अपने निश्चित दर गृह ऋण को नई आरआरएलआर-आधारित फ्लोटिंग ब्याज दर में बदलने के बारे में जानकारी प्राप्त करने के लिए अपने बैंक से संपर्क कर सकते हैं। वर्तमान में, नई आरआरएलआर व्यवस्था की शुरूआत से लागू होम लोन ब्याज दरों में कमी आई है।","IHL85":"12. क्या मैं फ्लोटिंग रेट होम लोन से फिक्स्ड रेट पर स्विच कर सकता हूं?","IHL86":"हां। कुछ लेंडर आपको फ्लोटिंग रेट से फिक्स्ड रेट होम लोन पर स्विच करने का विकल्प देते हैं और दूसरी तरफ। हालांकि, यह सभी होम लोन पर लागू नहीं है और इस रूपांतरण को लागू करने में कुछ शुल्क शामिल हैं। प्रक्रिया और आवश्यकताओं के बारे में विवरण प्राप्त करने के लिए अपने ऋणदाता से संपर्क करें।","IHL87":"13. मैं अपना होम लोन कैसे चुकाऊं?","IHL88":"आपके ऋण का भुगतान करने के विभिन्न तरीके हैं जैसे कि गृह ऋण की अवधि के लिए पोस्ट-डेटेड चेक जारी करना, आपके वेतन से स्वचालित रूप से राशि काटा जाना या ईसीएस (इलेक्ट्रॉनिक क्लियरिंग सिस्टम) के लिए ऋणदाता को मानक निर्देश जारी करना, जिसमें ईएमआई आपके बैंक से हर महीने अपने आप कट जाता है।","IHL89":"14. क्या मुझे सार्वजनिक या निजी बैंक में होम लोन के लिए आवेदन करना चाहिए?","IHL90":"होम लोन लेने से पहले, आपके लिए लागू होने वाली विभिन्न ब्याज दरों की तुलना करना सबसे अच्छा है। जब आप निवेश के माध्यम से गृह ऋण के लिए आवेदन करते हैं, तो आपको निजी और सार्वजनिक दोनों क्षेत्रों के बैंकों के माध्यम से गृह ऋण के लिए आवेदन करने का अवसर मिलता है। साथ ही, इस तथ्य को भी ध्यान में रखें कि जब आप होम लोन के लिए आवेदन करते हैं तो बैंक विभिन्न प्रोसेसिंग और अन्य संबंधित शुल्क लेते हैं और आपको होम लोन के लिए आवेदन करते समय इन पर भी विचार करना चाहिए।","IHL91":"15. क्या होम लोन के पूर्व भुगतान की अनुमति है?","IHL92":"हां, कोई व्यक्ति ऋण का भुगतान करने के लिए एकमुश्त भुगतान करके निर्धारित ऋण अवधि के पूरा होने से पहले ऋण राशि चुका सकता है। ऐसे मामलों में, बैंक बकाया मूल राशि के 2-3% की सीमा में कुछ दंड लागू करने का निर्णय ले सकता है। कुछ बैंक और एनबीएफसी (गैर-बैंकिंग वित्तीय कंपनियां) होम लोन के पूर्व भुगतान पर कोई जुर्माना नहीं लगाते हैं।","IHL93":"16. होम लोन प्रक्रिया से जुड़े प्रमुख शुल्क क्या हैं?","IHL94":"प्रसंस्करण शुल्क- ऋण के लिए आवेदन करते समय, ऋणदाता को एक शुल्क का भुगतान किया जाता है जिसे प्रसंस्करण शुल्क के रूप में जाना जाता है। भुगतान की गई राशि या तो ऋण राशि का प्रतिशत या एक निश्चित राशि हो सकती है जो ऋण स्वीकृति औपचारिकताओं को पूरा करने के बदले भुगतान की जाती है।","IHL95":"कमिटमेंट फी- लोन के प्रोसेस और मंज़ूरी के बाद एक निर्धारित समयावधि के भीतर उसका लाभ उठाना आवश्यक है अन्यथा कुछ वित्तीय संस्थान एक प्रतिबद्धता शुल्क लगाते हैं। प्रतिबद्धता शुल्क का भुगतान करके, आपको आश्वासन दिया जाता है कि आप ब्याज दर पर और उस अवधि के लिए ऋण प्राप्त कर सकते हैं जिस पर शुरू में सहमति हुई थी। अधिकांश बैंक अब यह शुल्क नहीं लेते हैं।","IHL96":"प्री-पेमेंट चार्ज- अगर लोन की अवधि पूरी होने से पहले पूरी लोन राशि का भुगतान कर दिया जाता है तो बैंक/वित्तीय संस्थान पेनल्टी लगा सकते हैं। जुर्माना राशि जिसे फोरक्लोज़र/पूर्व भुगतान शुल्क के रूप में भी जाना जाता है, ऋण अवधि के पूरा होने से पहले चुकाई गई ऋण राशि का अधिकतम 5% हो सकता है।","IHL97":"विविध शुल्क- दस्तावेज़ीकरण, स्टाम्प शुल्क, क्रेडिट ब्यूरो रिपोर्ट जारी करने का शुल्क और सलाहकार शुल्क आमतौर पर कुछ उधारदाताओं द्वारा विविध शुल्क के रूप में माना जाता है।","IHL98":"17. मुझे अपने होम लोन आवेदन के साथ कौन से दस्तावेज़ जमा करने होंगे?","IHL99":"जिन दस्तावेजों को जमा करने की आवश्यकता होती है, वे एक ऋणदाता से दूसरे में भिन्न हो सकते हैं। प्रस्तुत किए जाने वाले कुछ आवश्यक दस्तावेजों में निम्नलिखित शामिल हैं-","IHL100":"पूर्ण ऋण आवेदन पत्र","IHL101":"पासपोर्ट साइज फोटो","IHL102":"पहचान प्रमाण - पैन कार्ड / पासपोर्ट / डीएल / मतदाता पहचान पत्र","IHL103":"निवास प्रमाण- टेलीफोन या बिजली बिल/पासपोर्ट/वोटर आईडी/संपत्ति कर

कंपनी) के अधिकृत सर्वेक्षक/मूल्यांकनकर्ता से लागत अनुमान/मूल्यांकन रिपोर्ट।","IHL107":"हाउसिंग बोर्ड का आवंटन पत्र/सोसायटी/बिल्डर आदि का एनओसी और साथ ही कोई अन्य भूमि उपयोग प्रमाण पत्र/अन्य","IHL108":"18. क्या होम लोन पर कोई टैक्स बेनिफिट उपलब्ध है?","IHL109":"होम लोन पर टैक्स बेनिफिट दो वर्गों में बांटा गया है-","IHL110":"होम लोन के मूलधन के पुनर्भुगतान पर टैक्स छूट: यह टैक्स सेक्शन 80C के तहत सेक्शन के तहत अधिकतम 150,000 रुपये की वार्षिक टैक्स कटौती के साथ छूट की अनुमति है।","IHL111":"होम लोन के लिए ब्याज दर पर टैक्स बेनिफिट: इनकम टैक्स एक्ट की धारा 24 के तहत, आप होम लोन पर चुकाए गए ब्याज की राशि पर स्व-अधिकृत संपत्ति के लिए अधिकतम रु.2 लाख।","IHL112":"संयुक्त उधारकर्ताओं के लिए कर लाभ: संयुक्त गृह ऋण के मामले में, प्रत्येक सह-उधारकर्ता कुल रु. 3.5 लाख (धारा 80सी के तहत 1.5 लाख + धारा 24 के तहत 2 लाख) कर छूट के रूप में। इसलिए, यदि एक विवाहित जोड़ा होम लोन के लिए सह-हस्ताक्षर करता है, तो वे उनके होम लोन पर  रु.7 लाख की कुल कर छूट का दावा कर सकते हैं। ।","IHL113":"19. टॉप अप लोन क्या है?","IHL114":"यदि आपके पास मौजूदा गृह ऋण है और आपने मौजूदा गृह ऋण का समय पर भुगतान किया है, तो आपको अपने वर्तमान गृह ऋण पर चुकाई गई राशि के बराबर अतिरिक्त ऋण उधार लेने का विकल्प मिल सकता है। इसे टॉप अप लोन कहा जाता है। टॉप अप लोन पर ब्याज दरें व्यक्तिगत ऋण से कम होती हैं और इस ऋण को संसाधित करने के लिए बहुत कम या कोई कागजी कार्रवाई की आवश्यकता नहीं होती है और धन का उपयोग कई प्रकार के खर्चों के लिए किया जा सकता है।","IHL115":"20. होम लोन के लिए साइन अप करते समय क्या मेरे पास सह-आवेदक हो सकता है?","IHL116":"हां। जब आप होम लोन के लिए आवेदन करते हैं तो आपके परिवार का कोई सदस्य जैसे आपका जीवनसाथी या आपके माता-पिता आपके साथ सह-हस्ताक्षर कर सकते हैं। आपके होम लोन के लिए सह-हस्ताक्षरकर्ता होने से आपके होम लोन की बड़ी राशि के लिए स्वीकृत होने की संभावना बढ़ जाती है। एक सह-हस्ताक्षरकर्ता की विशेष रूप से अनुशंसा की जाती है यदि प्राथमिक आवेदक का क्रेडिट स्कोर कम है या अतीत में ऋण का आवेदन / भुगतान करते समय समस्या हुई है।","IHL117":"21. क्या होम लोन के मामले में एक अच्छा क्रेडिट रिकॉर्ड होना महत्वपूर्ण है?","IHL118":"होम लोन एक लॉन्ग टर्म लोन (5 से 30 साल की अवधि) होता है, इसलिए लेंडर यह सुनिश्चित करना चाहते हैं कि उन्हें लॉन्ग टर्म में उनका पैसा वापस मिल जाए। इसलिए, आपको होम लोन मंजूर करने से पहले ऋण स्वीकृति प्राधिकारी निश्चित रूप से आपके क्रेडिट इतिहास की जांच करेगा। एक अच्छा क्रेडिट रिकॉर्ड/इतिहास होने से आपको कम जोखिम वाले उधारकर्ता के रूप में वर्गीकृत किया जाएगा और आप अपने क्रेडिट इतिहास के आधार पर विभिन्न बैंक शुल्क पर पसंदीदा (कम) ब्याज दरें और छूट प्राप्त करने में सक्षम हो सकते हैं।","IHL119":"22. मेरा क्रेडिट स्कोर कम है। क्या मैं अब भी होम लोन के लिए अप्लाई कर सकता हूं?","IHL120":"यदि आपका क्रेडिट स्कोर खराब है, तो आपको होम लोन प्राप्त करना मुश्किल होगा। हालाँकि, आप सह-उधारकर्ता प्राप्त करके अपने अवसरों में सुधार कर सकते हैं। सह-उधारकर्ता को आपके जीवनसाथी या माता-पिता की तरह परिवार का सदस्य होना चाहिए। आदर्श रूप से, आपको एक ऐसे सह-उधारकर्ता का चयन करना चाहिए जिसके पास एक सफल आवेदन की संभावना को बढ़ाने के लिए आय का एक नियमित स्रोत और अच्छा क्रेडिट इतिहास हो।","IHL121":"23. प्री-ईएमआई ब्याज क्या है?","IHL122":"जब बैंक आपको होम लोन मंजूर करते हैं, तो हो सकता है कि ईएमआई भुगतान तुरंत शुरू न हो। ऐसी स्थिति में, बैंक आपके ऋण पर प्री-ईएमआई ब्याज वसूलने के लिए उत्तरदायी होता है। यह ब्याज उस समय से मासिक रूप से देय है जब तक कि ईएमआई भुगतान शुरू नहीं हो जाता है। प्री-ईएमआई ब्याज राशि होम लोन ईएमआई से कम है क्योंकि मूल भुगतान भाग को प्री-ईएमआई ब्याज भुगतान के लिए बाहर रखा गया है।","IHL123":"24.  होम लोन पर मार्जिन क्या है?","IHL124":"होम लोन पर मार्जिन घर की लागत के प्रतिशत को संदर्भित करता है जो आपको होम लोन प्रदान करने वाले ऋणदाता द्वारा कवर नहीं किया जाता है। औसतन, ऋणदाता होम लोन पर 20% मार्जिन लागू करते हैं यानी आपको स्वीकृत होम लोन राशि संपत्ति की वास्तविक लागत का 80% होगी। होम लोन की लागत का शेष 20% आपको वहन करना होगा। हालांकि 20% मार्जिन उद्योग का औसत है, ऋणदाता मामले के आधार पर अपने होम लोन मार्जिन को बढ़ा या घटा सकते हैं।","IHL125":"25.  कौन सी लागतें होम लोन द्वारा कवर नहीं की जाती हैं?","IHL126":"मार्जिन के अलावा कुछ और खर्चे आपको वहन करने होंगे। इस संबंध में कुछ प्रमुख खर्चों में प्रारंभिक डाउन पेमेंट, स्टांप शुल्क लागत, रजिस्ट्रेशन लागत और हस्तांतरण शुल्क शामिल हैं।","IHL127":"26. एक परिशोधन अनुसूची क्या है?","IHL128":"परिशोधन एक तालिका है जिसमें ब्याज भुगतान और ऋण के आवधिक मूलधन के विवरण के साथ-साथ प्रत्येक भुगतान के बाद बकाया राशि और शून्य तक ऋण शेष राशि

चाहते हैं।","IHL135":"गृह सुधार ऋण: मौजूदा घर के मालिक जिनके पास अपने मौजूदा घर के नवीनीकरण के लिए पर्याप्त धन की कमी है, वे इस ऋण के लिए अपने घर को एक नई पेंट जॉब, बिजली के तारों, वाटर प्रूफिंग आदि के साथ अपग्रेड करने के लिए आवेदन कर सकते हैं।","IHL136":"गृह रूपांतरण ऋण: इस प्रकार के गृह ऋण का उपयोग करके, एक मौजूदा गृह स्वामी अपने मौजूदा ऋण में जोड़ सकता है ताकि वे एक नया घर खरीद सकें। इस प्रकार का ऋण केवल मौजूदा गृहस्वामियों पर लागू होता है।","IHL137":"एनआरआई होम लोन: ये होम लोन विशेष रूप से अनिवासी भारतीयों को वित्तपोषण प्रदान करने के लिए डिज़ाइन किए गए हैं ताकि वे भारत में घर खरीद सकें।","IHL138":"28. अगर मेरे पास मौजूदा होम लोन है और मैं नए घर में जाना चाहता हूं, तो मेरे पास क्या विकल्प है?","IHL139":"आपका सबसे अच्छा विकल्प गृह रूपांतरण ऋण के लिए आवेदन करना है। इस प्रकार के

द्वारा अपने ग्राहकों को प्रदान की जाने वाली एक सुविधा है, जो उन लोगों को अनुमति देता है जो संपत्ति खरीदने का फैसला करने से पहले ही अपनी योग्यता के बारे में विवरण के साथ एक घर खरीदना चाहते हैं।","IHL142":"30. होम लोन प्री-अप्रूवल कब तक वैध है?","IHL143":"प्री-अप्रूव्ड होम लोन ऑफ़र केवल एक सीमित अवधि के लिए मान्य है, जो कि ऋणदाता के आंतरिक नियमों और विनियमों के अनुसार एक बैंक से दूसरे बैंक में भिन्न होता है। हालाँकि, ये पूर्व-अनुमोदन आमतौर पर 6 महीने से अधिक के लिए मान्य नहीं होते हैं।","IHL144":"31. एक अपार्टमेंट और जमीन के प्लॉट के लिए होम लोन की आवश्यकताएं कैसे भिन्न होती हैं?","IHL145":"जब आप किसी अपार्टमेंट के लिए होम लोन लेते हैं, तो आप तकनीकी रूप से होम परचेज लोन के लिए अप्लाई करते हैं। इस प्रकार का ऋण सबसे आम है जो व्यक्तियों को प्रदान किया जाता है और धारा 24 और धारा 80सी के तहत कर लाभ के लिए पात्र है। यदि आप बाद में अपना घर बनाने के लिए जमीन का प्लॉट खरीदना चाहते हैं, तो आपको भूमि खरीद ऋण के लिए आवेदन करना होगा और इस प्रकार के ऋण के लिए वर्तमान में कोई कर छूट लाभ नहीं है।","IHL146":"32. भारत में शीर्ष गृह ऋण प्रदाता कौन से हैं?","IHL147":"होम लोन की भारी मांग के कारण, पूरे भारत में बैंक और NBFC अपने ग्राहकों को होम लोन प्रदान करते हैं। व्यक्तियों को

हैं जो इक्विटी में थोड़ा सा निवेश करना शुरू करना चाहते हैं। वे इन फंडों का उपयोग जोखिम भरे फंडों में आसानी के लिए प्रवेश द्वार के रूप में कर सकते हैं।<br/>\\nशौकिया निवेशकों को ऐसे फंडों में निवेश

है, 3 साल के क्षितिज में 10-12% रिटर्न के साथ इक्विटी परिसंपत्तियों की तुलना में मनी मार्केट इंस्ट्रूमेंट्स के उच्च अनुपात को देखते हुए, एक आक्रामक हाइब्रिड फंड मुख्य रूप से इक्विटी म्यूचुअल फंड हो सकता है। जोखिम प्रोफाइल और जैसा कि नाम से पता चलता है, उच्च रिटर्न दे सकता है हालांकि ये रिटर्न 3 साल के क्षितिज में एक शुद्ध इक्विटी फंड से कम होगा।","HMF61":"","HMF62":"4. सर्वश्रेष्ठ हाइब्रिड फंड का मूल्यांकन कैसे करें?","HMF63":"हाइब्रिड फंडों का मूल्यांकन उनके प्रकारों के आधार पर किया जा सकता है और इसे निवेशक के वित्तीय लक्ष्यों, जोखिम लेने की क्षमता और निवेश क्षितिज के साथ मिलान किया जा सकता है। विभिन्न व्यापारिक रणनीतियों को लागू करने वाले हाइब्रिड म्यूचुअल फंड कई प्रकार के हो सकते हैं:<br/><br/>\\nआर्बिट्रेज फंड - ये फंड नकदी और डेरिवेटिव बाजारों के बीच संपत्ति की कीमत में अंतर का फायदा उठाने के लिए आर्बिट्रेज रणनीति का उपयोग करते हैं। ये फंड मुख्य रूप से इक्विटी फंड हैं, जिसका अर्थ है कि परिसंपत्ति आवंटन का 65% इक्विटी में है और शेष ऋण साधनों में है। ये सभी फंडों में सबसे कम जोखिम वाले हैं, और इसलिए अत्यधिक तरल साधन हैं।<br/><br/>\\nकंजर्वेटिव हाइब्रिड फंड - जैसा कि नाम से ही पता चलता है, ये फंड इक्विटी सेगमेंट में 10% से 25% का केवल एक छोटा सा हिस्सा निवेश करते हैं, जबकि 75% से 90% के निवेश का हिस्सा डेब्टसिक्योरिटीज में होता है। ये बेहद सुरक्षित और जोखिम मुक्त निवेश हैं, जो पूंजी संरक्षण के साथ स्थिर रिटर्न पर ध्यान केंद्रित करते हैं।<br/><br/>\\nइक्विटी सेविंग्स फंड - इन पर इक्विटी फंड के रूप में कर लगाया जाता है क्योंकि वे पूंजी का न्यूनतम 65% इक्विटी परिसंपत्तियों में निवेश करते हैं, जबकि पूंजी की वृद्धि के साथ-साथ राजस्व सृजन दोनों को लक्षित करने के लिए ऋण प्रतिभूतियों में पूंजी का न्यूनतम 10% विविधता प्रदान करते हैं। जोखिम को कम करने के लिए इक्विटी सेगमेंट के एक्सपोजर को डेब्टइंस्ट्रूमेंट्स के साथ हेज किया जाता है।<br/><br/>\\nडायनेमिक एसेट एलोकेशन फंड - इन्हें बैलेंस्ड एडवांटेज फंड के रूप में भी जाना जाता है, क्योंकि फंड मैनेजर बाजार की स्थितियों के अनुसार सबसे अधिक फायदा उठाने के लिए एसेट एलोकेशन को बदलते हैं। इस फंड को चुनने वाले निवेशकों में मध्यम जोखिम लेने की क्षमता होनी चाहिए और निवेश की अवधि भी 5 साल तक होनी चाहिए। उदाहरण के लिए कहें कि इक्विटी की कीमतें कम हैं, तो फंड मैनेजर कम वैल्यूएशन पर स्टॉक खरीदते समय पूंजी की सराहना के उद्देश्य से इक्विटी में अधिक निवेश करेगा, और इसके विपरीत यदि इक्विटी की कीमतें बहुत अधिक हैं। इन पर आमतौर पर इक्विटी फंड के रूप में कर लगाया जाता है, लेकिन निवेशकों को निवेश करने से पहले हमेशा स्कीम इंफॉर्मेशन डॉक्यूमेंट (SID) की अच्छी तरह से जांच कर लेनी चाहिए।<br/><br/>\\nमल्टी-एसेट फंड- इन फंड्स के पीछे मूल दर्शन एक उत्पाद के माध्यम से निवेश के पूरी तरह से विविध पोर्टफोलियो को दोहराना है, जिसमें न्यूनतम 3 परिसंपत्ति वर्गों के साथ वर्ग भर में कई परिसंपत्तियों में निवेश किया जाता है। जो निवेशक अपने पोर्टफोलियो का प्रबंधन स्वयं नहीं करना चाहते हैं और एक विविध जोखिम प्रोफ़ाइल बनाए रखना चाहते हैं, उन्हें ऐसे फंडों का विकल्प चुनना चाहिए।<br/>\\nएग्रेसिव हाइब्रिड फंड- इक्विटी या इक्विटी से संबंधित उपकरणों के लिए उच्च परिसंपत्ति आवंटन 80% तक, न्यूनतम आवश्यकता 65% होने के कारण इन्हें हाइब्रिड इक्विटी म्यूचुअल फंड के रूप में भी जाना जाता है। बाकी का निवेश डेब्ट इंस्ट्रूमेंट्स में किया जाता है। इक्विटी में निवेश के उच्च हिस्से को देखते हुए, इन पर इक्विटी फंड के रूप में भी कर लगाया जाता है और यदि मध्यम अवधि के लिए रखा जाता है तो अक्सर पूंजी की वृद्धि होती है।","HMF70":"5. मुझे कब तक हाइब्रिड फंड्स में निवेशित रहना चाहिए?","HMF71":"हाइब्रिड म्यूचुअल फंड उन निवेशकों के लिए प्रवेश

प्राथमिकताओं से मेल खाने के लिए बनाए गए हैं। इन सभी विशेषताओं के आधार पर, और बाजार की लगातार बदलती परिस्थितियों को ध्यान में रखते हुए, इन फंडों को अलग-अलग समय के लिए रखा जा सकता है, जिसमें फिर से

होगी। इक्विटी निवेश के मामले में मुद्रास्फीति का प्रभाव विविध है। जबकि मुद्रास्फीति की दर अधिक है, यह एक मजबूत अर्थव्यवस्था का संकेत देता है। कई कंपनियों के पास अच्छा कारोबार होगा, और वे उच्च मजदूरी का भुगतान करेंगे। हालांकि, उन्हें कच्चा माल खरीदने के लिए अधिक निवेश की जरूरत है। इसका असर कंपनी के प्रॉफिट मार्जिन पर पड़ेगा। इस प्रकार, कंपनी का समग्र प्रदर्शन मुद्रास्फीति के प्रभावों से संबंधित

मुद्रास्फीति के सबसे सामान्य कारणों को सूचीबद्ध किया है।","inflation46":"मांग प्रेरित मुद्रास्फीति: जबकि कुछ सेवाओं और उत्पादों की कुल मांग अर्थव्यवस्था में कुल आपूर्ति से अधिक है, इसके परिणामस्वरूप मांग-पुल मुद्रास्फीति होती है। मांग आपूर्ति से अधिक हो सकती है, और यह कीमत को ऊपर की ओर बढ़ने का कारण बनती है।","inflation47":"कॉस्ट-पुश इन्फ्लेशन: जबकि सामग्री और मजदूरी की लागत बढ़ रही है, हम इसे कॉस्ट-पुश इन्फ्लेशन कहते हैं। एक एकाधिकार बनाने की क्षमता रखने वाला संगठन लागत-पुश मुद्रास्फीति के योगदानकर्ताओं में से एक होगा।","inflation48":"उच्च मुद्रा आपूर्ति: प्रचलन में कुल मौद्रिक राशि बढ़ी हुई मुद्रा आपूर्ति से संबंधित है। इसमें सिक्के, नकद, बैंक खाते और शेष शामिल हैं। जबकि मुद्रा आपूर्ति में तेजी से वृद्धि होती है, यह मुद्रास्फीति का कारण बन सकती है। उत्पादों की एक बड़ी मात्रा बहुत कम उत्पादों का पीछा कर सकती है।\\r","inflation49":"अवमूल्यन: यह देश की विनिमय दर में नीचे की ओर समायोजन को दर्शाता है। यह मुद्रा के मूल्यों को कम करेगा। मुद्रा का अवमूल्यन निर्यात को कम खर्चीला बना देगा। यह विदेशी देशों को अवमूल्यन वाले उत्पादों को खरीदने के लिए प्रोत्साहित करेगा। अवमूल्यन से ये विदेशी वस्तुएं महंगी हो जाएंगी। अवमूल्यन करने वाले राष्ट्र के उपभोक्ता घरेलू सामान खरीदेंगे न कि आयातित सामान।","inflation50":"वेतन में वृद्धि: मजदूरी को उत्पादन लागत में शामिल किया जाता है। जब मजदूरी में वृद्धि होती है, तो व्यवसायों के पास कम मार्जिन होगा। वे उच्च उत्पादकता और वेतन वृद्धि को संतुलित करेंगे। बढ़ती मजदूरी के कारण, उपभोक्ता अपनी क्रय क्षमता को प्रभावित किए बिना अधिक राशि का भुगतान करने में सक्षम होंगे।","inflation51":"रेगुलेशंस और नीतियां: कुछ नीतियां मांग-पुल और लागत-पुश मुद्रास्फीति के लिए जिम्मेदार हैं। जहां कुछ सामानों के लिए कर सब्सिडी है, वहीं मांग में वृद्धि होगी। अधिक मांग होने पर लागत में वृद्धि होगी। इसके अलावा, कड़े नियम और किराया स्थिरीकरण नियम लागत में वृद्धि का कारण बनेंगे। समग्र आर्थिक वातावरण मुद्रास्फीतिकारी होगा।\\n","inflation52":"कई अन्य कारक मुद्रास्फीति का कारण हो सकते हैं:<br/>\\n<ul>\\n<li>टैकनोलजी</li>\\n<li>पैसे की

मैनेजर पोर्टफोलियो बनाने के लिए अन्य बुनियादी बातों के बीच कमाई, संपत्ति और प्रबंधन के दृष्टिकोण का व्यापक विश्लेषण करते हैं। पोर्टफोलियो का उद्देश्य किसी कंपनी के आंतरिक मूल्य और बाजार मूल्य के बीच

इस प्रकार निवेशकों को लंबी अवधि के वित्तीय लक्ष्यों को प्राप्त करने में सक्षम बनाते हैं, जो किसी का ध्यान नहीं और कम मूल्य वाले शेयरों में निवेश करने से पहले सही समय पर निवेश करते हैं। इस प्रकार

कम मूल्य वाली कंपनियों में किया जाता है, इस बात की संभावना हमेशा बनी रहती है कि स्टॉक की कीमत स्थिर रह सकती है या भविष्य में और गिर सकती है। व्यवस्थित निवेश योजनाओं (SIP) में निवेश करके जोखिम को कम

राशि का निवेश करना चाहता है जो एक बार में ऐसा न करे। व्यवस्थित तरीके से निवेश आपको विभिन्न अवधियों में कई निवेश करके लेनदेन की कीमत को औसत करने की अनुमति देता है। एकल भुगतान जमा के विपरीत, यह विधि लंबी अवधि में अधिक रिटर्न प्रदान करने में मदद करती है क्योंकि निवेश अलग-अलग समय पर होता है। कोई भी व्यक्ति जो एकमुश्त निवेश करना चाहता है, वह सिस्टमेटिक ट्रांसफर प्लान (एसटीपी) का विकल्प चुन सकता है,
